# Instructions

To properly create an invoice PDF you need the net price & vat. An older system you are interacting with is not providing this in their billing information.

**Given the gross price of a product and the vat percentage, calculate the original net price & vat sum for the product.**

### Round the net price & vat accordingly
- 2.5 becomes 3
- 2.4 becomes 2

## Note
- Make use of the PHP [round](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.round.php) method.
- [Percentage](https://www.math.net/percentage)
- [Wikipedia on percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage)

## About the exercise
Working with a system that handles billing data can be cumbersome. Many different systems to interact with and all of them have their own id√©a on how to best structure their data. Some of theses systems, old systems, did not bother to include net prices & vat in their data model.
